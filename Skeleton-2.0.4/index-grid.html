      <p>The beaches of Zanzibar look like something plucked straight from paradise,Stunning stretches of white sand lie along its coast and although it’s now the world’s leading dive destination, diving is not the only water sport on offer in these stunning oceans.</p>
      <p>Zanzibar’s unique combination of people makes it a melting pot of not only different cultures but also different cuisines. Borrowing heavily from its early settlers, the food in Zanzibar has a mixture of Portuguese, Indian and Middle Eastern influences about it.</p>

Members of Parliament (MPs).For our country’s transition from apartheid rule to democracy, an interim constitution was negotiated between representatives of organisations involved in the liberation struggle, represented political parties and other interest groups. After the first democratic elections on 27 April 1994, members of the National Assembly and Senate, as the elected public representatives at the time, met as a body called the Constitutional Assembly to write a new Constitution. In 1996, after two years of public consultation and much debate, the new Constitution was finally adopted.
